# Motivation

The current "Getting Started" guide in `README.md` is quite complex and not exactly a gentle introduction to the RTOS.
To lower the barrier of entry, the guide could instead be based on the POSIX platform support.
This avoids cross-platform tool chains and ensures that new developers start out in a relatively familiar environment.


# Goals

- Create a "Getting Started" guide that makes it as simple as possible for new developers to follow it and gain some insight into application development on top of the RTOS.
- The new guide shall focus on working with RTOS releases instead of the source distribution to hide the complexities of code weaving with x.py.


# Release Impact: Patch


# Test Plan

- Review the changes introduced by this task, attempt to follow the new "Getting Started" guide, and provide feedback.
- Verify that all existing regression tests pass.
